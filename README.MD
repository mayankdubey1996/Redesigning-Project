I found bad graphs in which data is not presented upto the mark (as per the "stastical standard"). I used R programming language for the redesining purpose, converting them into good graph as per the "Statistical Standard".
Librarires like ggplot2 and micromapas were used. I also used gradient coloring to make it attractive.
